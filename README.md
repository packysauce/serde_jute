# this thing speaks jute

Howdy, if you found this you are about to be SERIOUSLY disappointed!
I work on zookeeper a lot, so I want some jute magic so I can build cool tools.
I also wanted to learn Rust! Sounds like a match made in heaven.

# Here's the deal: I don't know rust

This is my learning project. I'll happily accept PRs and tips/comments.
All I ask is just don't be a dick about it. If I have questions, it's because you know something I don't and I'd like to learn from you.

# Thanks for stopping by, have a good time githubbing!
